### The Swift Sweets
RSS for new Swift libs, sweet &amp; awesome!

### Why?
* Because when you create a new awesome Swift lib it can be difficult to reach out to all the awesome developers out there! Similarly it can be difficult as a developer to know what awesome Swift libs are created. So this is an initative to solve that problem – let's give it a try and please spread the word :-) Thank you!
